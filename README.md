# cl-tqdm
Simple and Fast Progress Bar Library for Common Lisp, inspired in tqdm.

(Optimizing hasn't done yet.)

![demo](https://gyazo.com/5bbc43310df9281c4711446ac7bb23b3/raw)

(Currently estimation of remaining time does not work well lol. Pull requests are welcome I got tired.)

This is the reimplementation of my old library [cl-cram](https://github.com/hikettei/cl-cram) because its APIs aren't useful and there is room to optimize.

## Run Test

```lisp
$ sbcl --script test.lisp
```

## Install

Coming soon...

## Documents

Coming soon...

But the whole code is very simple, so if you want to know the usage, it is the best way to read the source code `./cl-tqdm.lisp`
