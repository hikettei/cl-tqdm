# cl-tqdm
Simple and Fast ProgressBar Library for Common Lisp.

![demo](https://gyazo.com/5bbc43310df9281c4711446ac7bb23b3/raw)

Currently estimation of remaining time does not work well lol.

This is the reimplementation of my old library [cl-cram](https://github.com/hikettei/cl-cram) because its APIs aren't useful and there is room to optimize.

## Run Test

```lisp
$ sbcl --script test.lisp
```

## Documents

Coming soon...

But the whole code is very simple, so if you want to know the usage, it is the best way to read the source code `./cl-tqdm.lisp`
